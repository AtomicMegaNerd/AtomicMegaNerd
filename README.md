- 🤖 Greetings, I am @AtomicMegaNerd.
- 👋 你好。我在学习中文。虽然学中文有点难，我还喜欢这样做。很高兴认识你！
- 🐍 At work I have wrtten a ton of Python and Java.  I am learning Go.  I have also coded in Scala, C++, JavaScript (and variants like TypeScript), PHP, and even Lua. I have dabbled in Haskell and Rust.
- 🐟 I love the fish shell because it is awesome.
- 🥷 I am also learning how to become a speedy code ninja in Neovim.  LSP and tmux make Neovim awesome!  This is how I write code these days.
- 💻 I spend most of my computing time on UNIX-based systems like macOS and Linux.
- 🐧 Lately I have been having a lot of fun with Nix ❄️. In fact, my Mac and my Linux box are both using Nix. This is a really fun rabbit hole!
- 🛠 Other tools that I love include iTerm and Amethyst on the Mac, as well as the modern UNIX stuff like exa, bat, duf, dust, and htop.
