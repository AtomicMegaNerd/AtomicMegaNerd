- 🤖 Greetings, I am @AtomicMegaNerd.
- 👋 你好。我在学习中文。虽然学中文有点难，我还喜欢这样做。很高兴认识你！
- 👀 I am keenly interested in programming languages that have interesting type systems or are novel in some way.
- I am learning Rust and hope to become an expert.
- I also dabbled in Haskell and hope to explore it more one day when I have more time.
- 🐟 I love the fish shell because it is awesome.
- 🥷 I am also learning how to become a speedy code ninja in NeoVim.  LSP makes NeoVim awesome!
